represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      Terminology\n      -----------\n\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n\n\n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n\n      ```js\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n\n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n\n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n\n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @class Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n        if (!lib$es6$promise$utils$$isFunction(resolver)) {\n          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n        }\n\n        if (!(this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise)) {\n          lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n        }\n\n        lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver);\n      }\n    }\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\n    /**\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function(user){\n        // user is available\n      }, function(reason){\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Chaining\n      --------\n\n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return 'default name';\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `'default name'`\n      });\n\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n\n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // The user's comments are now available\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Simple Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var result;\n\n      try {\n        result = findResult();\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n      findResult(function(result, err){\n        if (err) {\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findResult().then(function(result){\n        // success\n      }, function(reason){\n        // failure\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var author, books;\n\n      try {\n        author = findAuthor();\n        books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n\n      function foundBooks(books) {\n\n      }\n\n      function failure(reason) {\n\n      }\n\n      findAuthor(function(author, err){\n        if (err) {\n          failure(err);\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          try {\n            findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n              if (err) {\n                failure(err);\n              } else {\n                try {\n                  foundBooks(books);\n                } catch(reason) {\n                  failure(reason);\n                }\n              }\n            });\n          } catch(error) {\n            failure(err);\n          }\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findAuthor().\n        then(findBooksByAuthor).\n        then(function(books){\n          // found books\n      }).catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method then\n      @param {Function} onFulfilled\n      @param {Function} onRejected\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      then: function(onFulfillment, onRejection) {\n        var parent = this;\n        var state = parent._state;\n\n        if (state === lib$es6$promise$$internal$$FULFILLED && !onFulfillment || state === lib$es6$promise$$internal$$REJECTED && !onRejection) {\n          return this;\n        }\n\n        var child = new this.constructor(lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop);\n        var result = parent._result;\n\n        if (state) {\n          var callback = arguments[state -

Defaults to 20.\n   * - attributesToRetrieve: a string that contains the list of object attributes\n   * you want to retrieve (let you minimize the answer size).\n   *   Attributes are separated with a comma (for example \"name,address\").\n   *   You can also use an array (for example [\"name\",\"address\"]).\n   *   By default, all attributes are retrieved. You can also use '*' to retrieve all\n   *   values when an attributesToRetrieve setting is specified for your index.\n   * - attributesToHighlight: a string that contains the list of attributes you\n   *   want to highlight according to the query.\n   *   Attributes are separated by a comma. You can also use an array (for example [\"name\",\"address\"]).\n   *   If an attribute has no match for the query, the raw value is returned.\n   *   By default all indexed text attributes are highlighted.\n   *   You can use `*` if you want to highlight all textual attributes.\n   *   Numerical attributes are not highlighted.\n   *   A matchLevel is returned for each highlighted attribute and can contain:\n   *      - full: if all the query terms were found in the attribute,\n   *      - partial: if only some of the query terms were found,\n   *      - none: if none of the query terms were found.\n   * - attributesToSnippet: a string that contains the list of attributes to snippet alongside\n   * the number of words to return (syntax is `attributeName:nbWords`).\n   *    Attributes are separated by a comma (Example: attributesToSnippet=name:10,content:10).\n   *    You can also use an array (Example: attributesToSnippet: ['name:10','content:10']).\n   *    By default no snippet is computed.\n   * - minWordSizefor1Typo: the minimum number of characters in a query word to accept one typo in this word.\n   * Defaults to 3.\n   * - minWordSizefor2Typos: the minimum number of characters in a query word\n   * to accept two typos in this word. Defaults to 7.\n   * - getRankingInfo: if set to 1, the result hits will contain ranking\n   * information in _rankingInfo attribute.\n   * - aroundLatLng: search for entries around a given\n   * latitude/longitude (specified as two floats separated by a comma).\n   *   For example aroundLatLng=47.316669,5.016670).\n   *   You can specify the maximum distance in meters with the aroundRadius parameter (in meters)\n   *   and the precision for ranking with aroundPrecision\n   *   (for example if you set aroundPrecision=100, two objects that are distant of\n   *   less than 100m will be considered as identical for \"geo\" ranking parameter).\n   *   At indexing, you should specify geoloc of an object with the _geoloc attribute\n   *   (in the form {\"_geoloc\":{\"lat\":48.853409, \"lng\":2.348800}})\n   * - insideBoundingBox: search entries inside a given area defined by the two extreme points\n   * of a rectangle (defined by 4 floats: p1Lat,p1Lng,p2Lat,p2Lng).\n   *   For example insideBoundingBox=47.3165,4.9665,47.3424,5.0201).\n   *   At indexing, you should specify geoloc of an object with the _geoloc attribute\n   *   (in the form {\"_geoloc\":{\"lat\":48.853409, \"lng\":2.348800}})\n   * - numericFilters: a string that contains the list of numeric filters you want to\n   * apply separated by a comma.\n   *   The syntax of one filter is `attributeName` followed by `operand` followed by `value`.\n   *   Supported operands are `<`, `<=`, `=`, `>` and `>=`.\n   *   You can have multiple conditions on one attribute like for example numericFilters=price>100,price<1000.\n   *   You can also use an array (for example numericFilters: [\"price>100\",\"price<1000\"]).\n   * - tagFilters: filter the query by a set of tags. You can AND tags by separating them by commas.\n   *   To OR tags, you must add parentheses. For example, tags=tag1,(tag2,tag3) means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n   *   You can also use an array, for example tagFilters: [\"tag1\",[\"tag2\",\"tag3\"]]\n   *   means tag1 AND (tag2 OR tag3).\n   *   At indexing, tags should be added in the _tags** attribute\n   *   of objects (for example {\"_tags\":[\"tag1\",\"tag2\"]}).\n   * - facetFilters: filter the query by a list of facets.\n   *   Facets are separated by commas and each facet is encoded as `attributeName:value`.\n   *   For example: `facetFilters=category:Book,author:John%20Doe`.\n   *   You can also use an array (for example `[\"category:Book\",\"author:John%20Doe\"]`).\n   * - facets: List of object attributes that you want to use for faceting.\n   *   Comma separated list: `\"category,author\"` or array `['category','author']`\n   *   Only attributes that have been added in **attributesForFaceting** index setting\n   *   can be used in this parameter.\n   *   You can also use `*` to perform faceting on all attributes specified in **attributesForFaceting**.\n   * - queryType: select how the query words are interpreted, it can be one of the following value:\n   *    - prefixAll: all query words are interpreted as prefixes,\n   *    - prefixLast: only the last word is interpreted as a prefix (default behavior),\n   *    - prefixNone: no query word is interpreted as a prefix. This option is not recommended.\n   * - optionalWords: a string that contains the list of words that should\n   * be considered as optional when found in the query.\n   *   Comma separated and array are accepted.\n   * - distinct: If set to 1, enable the distinct feature (disabled by default)\n   * if the attributeForDistinct index setting is set.\n   *   This feature is similar to the SQL \"distinct\" keyword: when enabled\n   *   in a query with the distinct=1 parameter,\n   *   all hits containing a duplicate value for the attributeForDistinct attribute are removed from results.\n   *   For example, if the chosen attribute is show_name and several hits have\n   *   the same value for show_name, then only the best\n   *   one is kept and others are removed.\n   * - restrictSearchableAttributes: List of attributes you want to use for\n   * textual search (must be a subset of the attributesToIndex index setting)\n   * either comma separated or as an array\n   * @param callback the result callback called with two arguments:\n   *  error: null or Error('message').
