     * The new context starts at the first node (root) and stops at the node for the `state` parameter.
     *
     * #### Why
     *
     * When a transition is created, the nodes in the "To Path" are injected from a ResolveContext.
     * A ResolveContext closes over a path of [[PathNode]]s and processes the resolvables.
     * The "To State" can inject values from its own resolvables, as well as those from all its ancestor state's (node's).
     * This method is used to create a narrower context when injecting ancestor nodes.
     *
     * @example
     * `let ABCD = new ResolveContext([A, B, C, D]);`
     *
     * Given a path `[A, B, C, D]`, where `A`, `B`, `C` and `D` are nodes for states `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`:
     * When injecting `D`, `D` should have access to all resolvables from `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`.
     * However, `B` should only be able to access resolvables from `A`, `B`.
     *
     * When resolving for the `B` node, first take the full "To Path" Context `[A,B,C,D]` and limit to the subpath `[A,B]`.
     * `let AB = ABCD.subcontext(a)`
     */
    subContext(state: State): ResolveContext;
    /**
     * Adds Resolvables to the node that matches the state
     *
     * This adds a [[Resolvable]] (generally one created on the fly; not declared on a [[StateDeclaration.resolve]] block).
     * The resolvable is added to the node matching the `state` parameter.
     *
     * These new resolvables are not automatically fetched.
     * The calling code should either fetch them, fetch something that depends on them,
     * or rely on [[resolvePath]] being called when some state is being entered.
     *
     * Note: each resolvable's [[ResolvePolicy]] is merged with the state's policy, and the global default.
