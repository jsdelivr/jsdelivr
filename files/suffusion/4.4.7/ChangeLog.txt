=============================
1.	Changed from using "live" to "on" for JQuery functions
2.	Switched back from modified version of Fancybox and Colorbox to original versions, since JQuery Tooltip can be used without modifying those libraries.
3.	Switched the image_resize call to wp_get_image_editor, since image_resize is deprecated in WP 3.5
4.	Added filter "suffusion_cat_tag_query_args" to featured posts for letting users add their own parameters to the query.

Version 4.4.5 - 09th Jan 2013
=============================
1.	Removed the pointer API from the code, as a result of a WPTRT guideline.
2.	Added support for JetPack's Photon-based resizing.

Version 4.4.4 - 12th Dec 2012
=============================
1.	Fixed some code in the featured content slider that was causing a JS conflict in JQuery 1.8.3 (WP 3.5)
2.	Removed the suffusion-widgets, suffusion-multic and suffusion-column shortcodes as a result of a new WPTRT guideline.

Version 4.4.3 - 27th Nov 2012
=============================
1.	Removed BP integration content as that (and more) is available with Suffusion BuddyPress Pack.
2.	Completely separated out conditional WPML code so that it doesn't load with the theme.
3.	Moved CSS generation code to dedicated CSS generation file from functions.php. This reduces the load for those scenarios where CSS doesn't need to be generated.
4.	Added option to disable widgets. This way unused widgets don't contribute to code.
5.	Removed the BGIFrame library since the theme isn't aiming to support IE6.
6.	Fixed a problem that was causing all tiles to be of the same height.
7.	Deleted some functions that were no longer being used.
8.	Changed some default settings to be switched off rather than on.

Version 4.4.2 - 11th Nov 2012

2.	Fixed a problem with the slider index appearing twice.
3.	Tiles were appearing too shortened. This has been addressed.
4.	Moved the responsive CSS generation to another file, which is only loaded if responsive settings are on.

Version 4.4.1 - 10th Nov 2012
=============================
1.	Added missing container element around the category description in the magazine layout.
2.	Fixed a bug that was causing images to ignore a custom size specified by the HTML attributes width and height.

2.	Fixed a bug where the number of columns in the "Widgets in Header" was not taking effect.
3.	Introduced responsive features for the theme.
4.	Killed the "Suffusion Meta" widget, which was, for all intents and purposes identical to the default Meta widget.
5.	Replaced static markup calls in sidebar.php with the_widget() calls for corresponding widgets.
6.	Fixed an issue where the audio shortcode wasn't firing even if enabled.
7.	Webkit browsers were not creating tile layouts / magazine template with equal-sized boxes automatically. This has been fixed.
8.	"Featured Posts" widget was repeating the post index - this has now been fixed.
9.	Replaced the JS-based + CSS-columns-based automatic width balancer with a pure CSS solution with better browser compatibility.
10. Left and Right arrow icons were reversed in one iconset
11. For posts without titles the "Query Posts" widget was not showing anything if a "list" of post titles was being displayed. This has
	been rectified to mimic the behaviour of the native "Recent Posts" widget.
12.	Got rid of 404 errors for FancyBox on IE6 - theme doesn't aim for IE6 support, so FancyBox support for it was not needed either.

Version 4.3.3 - 26th Sep 2012
=============================

3.	There was a problem with floating in the meta box in the post edit screen. This has been addressed.
4.	Shortcodes are going to be handled in the "Suffusion Shortcodes" plugin (submitted for approval). Correspondingly changes have been made in the theme.

=============================
1.  Fixed a minor issue in the default background colours of the Photonique and Minima skins.

1.  Removed deprecated API calls for WP 3.4 (add_contextual_help, suffusion_version_checker which used get_theme_data).
2.  Added support for native Custom Headers. This only works for WP 3.4 and upwards, because Suffusion supports flexible width headers, which are not available with older versions.

4.  Added new icon set based on Web Design Creatives licensed under GPL (http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=iconset:webdesigncreative)

	however users can choose to hide the comment form on the front-end if they wish.
21.	Bundled 2 post format icon sets with the theme. These can be used with the post format icon placeholders, which are sprite-enabled. Native integration will

9. Removed dynamic retrieval of theme version. This is now set up via a "define" call.
10. Separated most sidebar content into their own sidebar-* files, sidebar-above-footer.php, sidebar-below-header.php,
	sidebar-nav-main-right.php, sidebar-nav-main-left.php, sidebar-nav-top-left.php, sidebar-above-header.php, sidebar-in-header.php
11. Streamlined suffusion-options-page.php by moving JS code out to admin.js. The previous file suffusion-misc.js has been merged with this file.
12. Deleted redundant functions because they are not used: suffusion_update_available, suffusion_nr_entity_prepositions.
13. Moved these functions from functions.php to suffusion-options-page.php: suffusion_get_allowed_pages, suffusion_get_formatted_link_array,
	suffusion_get_formatted_wp_menu_array
14. Fixed a bug in the navigation menus, which weren't accepting the "highlight" colour.

Version 3.8.3 - 14th Sep 2011
=============================
1. Removed a $_SERVER check from comments.php (Trac ticket #4622).
2. Ensured that wp_head() is the last call before </head> (Trac ticket #4622).
3. Removed all function declarations from magazine.php. Some have been moved to functions.php and for the others the code has been directly inserted into the loops (Trac ticket #4622).
4. Fixed a problem with the display of asides and other post formats in Minima (Trac ticket #4622).
5. Fixed an issue where if the last item in a post was a floated image, things were not clearing properly (Trac ticket #4622).
6. Fixed an issue with nested comment styling (Trac ticket #4622).
7. Fixed table styling in main content and comments (Trac ticket #4622).
8. DID NOT Introduce support for native WP header customization (Trac ticket #4622). The functionality being implemented in the theme is "Custom Header BACKGROUND",
   not "Custom Image Header". See http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/theme-reviewers/2011-September/006871.html and the ensuing thread,
   particularly http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/theme-reviewers/2011-September/006876.html, where I was asked to build something custom.
9. Introduced support for native WP background customization (Trac ticket #4622). If there is a custom background the theme background settings are ignored. The theme options have been retained for backwards compatibility.
10. Minor bug fix to allow displaying of the "Links" title in the "Static Tabbed Sidebar"
11. The global variable "suffusion_options" had been erroneously renamed to "rg_options" in the last version. This has been rolled back.
12. Changed login.php to redirect to home_url instead of site_url
13. Added "CDATA" tags to the Twitter widget so that the code passes XHTML validation.
14. Fixed a bug in the "Featured Posts" widget where the "Previous" and "Next" buttons were only showing if the slider index was activated.
15. Fixed a bug in the "Query Posts" widget where the posts were not displaying in a random order if a random order was requested.
16. Fixed a bug in image thumbnail functionality that wasn't escaping special characters in the image "alt" attribute.
17. Minor change: text domain added to translation string in static tabbed sidebar.
18. Changed the use of TEMPLATEPATH to get_template_directory() and STYLESHEETPATH to get_stylesheet_directory();
19. Moved out Tile/Magazine bylines to their own template file (byline-tile.php)
20. Moved out pagination of Mosaic layout, comments and posts to their own template files - pagination-mosaic.php, pagination-comments.php and pagination-posts.php.
21. Moved out SEO options to its own template file, seo.php.
22. Moved out pullout style meta information display (suffusion_meta_pullout_for_post and suffusion_meta_pullout_for_page) into its own template files, pullout.php and pullout-page.php.
23. Moved out Navigation Menu functionality to its own template file, navigation.php.
24. Moved out the post header (title + meta) and post footer (meta) to their own templates, post-header.php and post-footer.php
25. Moved out the breadcrumb functionality to its own template, breadcrumb.php
26. Moved out the Previous/Next post functionality to its own file, prev-next.php
27. Moved out functions designed for potential BP child themes to a separate file, bp-integration.php
28. Split out BuddyPress styles to another sheet called bp.css. This isn't a BP theme by default, so BP styles will only be loaded if BP is active.
	Also added "function_exists" checks to all the functions to ensure backwards compatibility.
29. Deleted unused method suffusion_comment_pagination.
30. Changed code for printing the title to use wp_title() instead of get_bloginfo(). This is to ensure full compatibility with SEO plugins.
31. Removed redundant function suffusion_in_place_post_navigation.
32. Use one instance of meta-box callback in Edit Post/Edit Page instead of 2.
33. Changed default formatting of text to be left/right instead of "justify".
34. Pushed the file inclusion in suffusion-widgets.php to happen upon the "widgets_init" action. This will ensure that the files are included only on screens that need it.
	This speeds up a lot of the loading process.
35. Added option to disable the aspect ratio preservation of images, under Other Graphical Elements -> Miscellaneous.
36. Did major stylesheet cleanup to remove redundant styles. Also optimized the menu CSS
37. Removed the FAQ section from the options panel (it was dated).

39. Added option to hide the "Allowed HTML tags" message below the comment form.
40. Fixed a minor issue with label styling in comment forms. All labels in the comment form were getting assigned a style whether they belonged to Suffusion or not.
41. Fixed a bug where the "No Sidebars" layout was not being picked by single posts.
42. Fixed a bug in the magazine layout and the tiled layout that showed up if the # of sidebars in that layout was custom.
43. Added option to disable Featured Content on second/third etc pages from an archive view (disabled by default).
44. Added option to disable full content posts on second/third etc pages of a tiled/list/mosaic layout (disabled by default)

46. Disabled version checker because SimplePie was causing memory issues for some users.
47. Added capability to export id-based options (featured content, custom menus etc)
48. Converted a lot of images to sprites in style.css.
49. Changed the definition of suffusion_replace_page_with_alt_title and suffusion_unlink_page to use cached post-meta information

4. Added a new "Query Users Widget" to display site users and/or a user profile.
5. Added a new "Child Pages Widget" to display child pages for a current page. The title of the widget supports short-codes, so you
   can say [suffusion-the-post display='title'] for the title to automatically pull the title of the parent page.
6. Added support for manual excerpts in pages.
7. Changed code to not store "default" for a post template while saving.
8. Renamed the "Category Posts" widget to "Query Posts". Added capabilities to display recent posts, random posts

11. Removed the use of "jquery-dialog" from the admin panel. The screen-specific help texts have been added via the add_contextual_help function.
	Some admin panel text markup was changed to make it look better in the contextual help screen. This should make the back-end slightly faster.
12. There was a problem with the "No Sidebars" template in IE7, where if there was no widget area below header/above footer, and if
	comments were disabled, the content boxes shrunk to the width of the title.
13. Added a fix for an IE8 bug that doesn't show post thumbnails when floated.
14. Updated translation file.

2. Replaced deprecated call to caller_get_posts with ignore_sticky_posts in the Featured Content.
3. Replaced the JQuery Cycle scripts with the older version - the new one wasn't working in some cases.
4. Replaced output buffering where possible (the_tags, the_category, suffusion_print_author_byline). A couple of uses still remain,
   but those are for cases where there is no "non-echoing" getter.
5. Added classes to the post_class response to show the category id (category-xx-id), sequence number of the post (post-seq-1, post-seq-2 etc)
   and post parity (post-parity-odd, post-parity-even).
6. Fixed a bug that was causing the Featured Post Widget in a flattened "Widget Area Below Header" and "Widget Area Above Footer" to get squished.
7. Fixed a bug that would cause incorrect widths and a JS error in IE6.

5. Fixed a problem with widget styles in the bottom sidebars. They were taking the styles of the top sidebars earlier.
6. Made a couple of corrections to use get_the_title() instead of $post->post_title, to ensure that filters are applied correctly.

10. Added byline customization for Custom Post Formats (Other Graphical Elements -> Post Formats)
11. Added capability to display a permalink if there is no post title: this is enabled by default.

15. Added byline support for Tile Layout and the Magazine Template.
16. Added thumbnail support for Category Posts widget.

29. Added a search form to the 404 page

31. Removed reference to JQuery Accordion from JQuery UI JS files, since the library was not being used.

7. Made function names consistent (ensured that all functions and classes began with the name "suffusion" or "suf")
